üö® Emergency Vehicle Traffic Signal Siren System

An open-source system to improve emergency vehicle navigation through traffic lights by adding siren indicators linked to encrypted proximity signals. Designed to save lives and reduce response times for ambulances, fire engines, and police cars. MIT Licensed for global adoption. This concept was originally published on Twitter on March 21st 2019 [https://x.com/Cryptopoly/status/1108675815846436865].

Purpose
This project introduces a simple yet powerful concept to improve the safety and efficiency of emergency vehicle navigation through traffic-controlled areas. The aim is to save lives by reducing response times for ambulances, fire engines, police cars, and other emergency services vehicles.

Concept
The system integrates a physical siren indicator on top of traffic lights that activates when emergency vehicles approach. These indicators:

Provide a clear, visual warning to motorists of an incoming emergency vehicle.
Help traffic clear in advance, making navigation safer and faster for emergency services.
The system utilizes a secure communication network between emergency vehicles and traffic lights, ensuring:

Encrypted signals to prevent abuse.
Geofenced proximity activation, where traffic lights are updated when emergency vehicles are within a defined radius.

üí° Key Features
Low-cost infrastructure: Utilizes existing traffic light systems with an additional siren module.
Open-source and free to adopt: Designed under the MIT License for worldwide accessibility.
Expandable: Can integrate with future traffic management or autonomous vehicle systems.

üåç Vision
The goal is to provide governments, municipalities, and private organizations with a ready-to-implement solution that increases safety for emergency services, drivers, and pedestrians. This system is free to use and modify for the benefit of all communities.
